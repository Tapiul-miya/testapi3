# NJ Beach Tracker

Who doesn’t love a day at the beach? <br>
It can be one of the most fun and relaxing things to do during summer.

But it can also be tricky to decide what day is best, and which beach.
Ocean City Beach may be 75°F and cloudy one day, while Brigantine Beach
might be a perfect 88°F and clear skies just 30 minutes away!

<b>NJ Beach Tracker</b> is here to show you the best (and closest) beaches on any given day.

The site provides a live 5-day report of weather forecast information for 28 of New Jersey's most popular beaches. Driving times to each beach can also be compared once an address is entered.
